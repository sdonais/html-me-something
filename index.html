						<figcaption>Those eyes!</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>About Shay, Shakespeare penned: "though she be but little, she is fierce!" She's also magical. Her eyes and face are everything. Shay is 8 years old and she was adopted from Partners for Pets in Troy, IL in 2013.</p>

						<figcaption>A soft belly that's <em>excellent</em> for petting.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Beachy has middle child syndrome. It is not helped by his brattiness, but he is very sweet and loving. He's a <b>great</b> big brother to Riku. Beachy is 6 and was adopted from St Louis County Animal Care & Control when he was a kitten.</p>

						<figcaption>What a chonker.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Riku is the baby, which means he is very cute, very manipulative, and very spoiled. He gets away with everything. He also has no neck. Riku is 5 and I found him in an acquaintance's yard in Independence, MO when he was 12 weeks old.</p>

						<figcaption>My best friend and soul dog.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Wow, where do I even begin? Ash is a 3 year old blue merle Australian shepherd. I knew it would be fun to get a dog, but I never imagined he would be so loving, sweet, goofy and exuberant. His happiness is contagious, he loves everyone and he's the life of the party, always. I am honored <em><b>every day</b></em> to be his mom and friend.</p>

						<figcaption>Stunner!</figcaption>

					<p>Ari is a 17-year-old red motley corn snake. I got him when I was 12! He's an excellent ambassador snake. He loves to eat, shed, poop, and sleep with his mouth open.</p>

						<figcaption>Such a sweet face.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Cookie is a 5-year-old albino Nelson's milk snake. She is really cute and sweet. She loves to eat, climb, and lounge. I drove a few hours to the middle of nowhere in Illinois to adopt her off craigslist.</p>

					<p>Aurelia is a 4-year-old anery tessera stripe corn snake. She is pretty shy, and this is her baby picture. She looks the same now, just bigger. She also loves to eat.</p>

						<img src="C:/Users/Shelby/Documents/CoderGirl/html-me-something/images/snakes-mykonos-01.jpg">
						<figcaption>Givin' the ole side-eye.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Mykonos is a 4-year-old Mexican black king snake (with a Greek name for fun). He can be rather grumpy and prefers to be left alone. He has been voted "Most Likely to Bite", but he only bit me once and it really wasn't that bad. It was almost cute.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
					<h2>Devo</h2>
					<figure>
						<img src="C:/Users/Shelby/Documents/CoderGirl/html-me-something/images/snakes-devo-02.jpg">
						<figcaption>I love his colors!</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Devo is a 4-year-old Sonoran desert king snake. When I first got him as a baby he wasn't that great of an eater, but I'm proud to say he has a great appetite now. He has the same colors that his species would in the wild, in the Sonoran desert of Arizona, and I love that about him.</p>

					<h2>Saturn</h2>
					<figure>
						<img src="C:/Users/Shelby/Documents/CoderGirl/html-me-something/images/snakes-saturn-03.jpg">
						<figcaption>So pretty!</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Saturn is an amazing 3-year-old palmetto corn snake. He's one of my dream snakes! I was so happy to bring him home this year. He is white with multi-colored speckles. He loves hair and will sit on my head in my hair for hours. (Fun fact: this is a pretty common past time for snakes.)</p>
